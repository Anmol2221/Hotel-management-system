## Challenges Faced

- **Routing and Backend Integration:**  
  Ensuring seamless navigation and correct data flow between HTML pages and backend logic was a major challenge, especially as the project expanded to include both admin and customer modules.
- **Database Design and Integration:**  
  Designing the database schema and integrating it with Flask to handle room availability, customer data, and booking status required multiple iterations and careful debugging.
- **Learning HTML and Frontend Development:**  
  Building modern, responsive pages while learning HTML and CSS from scratch added significant complexity, but greatly improved the projectâ€™s appearance and usability.
